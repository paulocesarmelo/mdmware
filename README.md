# MDMWARE: Model-Driven Domain-Specific Middleware for Smart Cities

## Summary

The increasing complexity of Smart Cities requires the integration of heterogeneous platforms, diverse urban resources, and applications from multiple domains. This complexity introduces significant challenges in achieving semantic interoperability between application requirements and platform capabilities. To bridge this **semantic gap**, this thesis proposes **MDMWARE**, a **Model-Driven Domain-Specific Middleware** designed to systematically facilitate this integration.

Leveraging the principles of **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**, MDMWARE introduces a comprehensive architecture supported by key artifacts:

- **DSK (Domain-Specific Knowledge)**: Models domain-specific semantic abstractions.
- **PSK (Platform-Specific Knowledge)**: Represents smart city platform resources and capabilities.
- **Model-Driven Adapter**: A mechanism that maps domain-specific abstractions to platform capabilities.

MDMWARE was evaluated in various **demonstrative scenarios**, including **Smart Street Lighting, Autonomous Vehicles, Smart Grids, and Emergency Care for Home Patients**. The experiments demonstrated its effectiveness in integrating domain and platform semantics while reducing the complexity of smart city application development.
